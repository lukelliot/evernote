# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
#   # reset tables
#   User.delete_all
#   Note.delete_all
#
#   # users
#   one = User.create(email: 'one@fake.com', password: 'password')
#   two = User.create(email: 'two@fake.com', password: 'password')
#   three = User.create(email: 'three@fake.com', password: 'password')
